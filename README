OpenFFA
=======

OpenFFA is a simple free-for-all deathmatch mod for Quake 2, an open source replacement
for ‘RegularDM’ mode of OSP Tourney. Currently in development, it features
familiar scoreboard and HUD, voting system, configurable map rotation support,
high scores logging, ‘proper’ in-eyes chasecam support. Besides that, OpenFFA fixes
some gameplay bugs and annoyances original Quake 2 game library has.

Server configuration
--------------------

Some custom OpenFFA cvars are described below.

- `set g_idle_time 0` (integer)  
Time, in seconds, after which inactive players are automatically put into
spectator mode. Default value of zero disables this feature.

- `set g_maps_random 2` (integer)  
Specifies whether map list is traversed in random on sequental order.
   - 0 - sequental order
   - 1 - random order
   - 2 - random order, never allows the same map to be picked twice in a row

- `set g_maps_file ""` (string)  
Specifies name of the file to load map list from. Should not include any
extenstion part or slashes.

- `set g_defaults_file ""` (string)  
If this variable is not empty and there are some settings modified by voting,
server will execute the specified config file after 5 minutes pass without
any active players. Config file should reset all votable variables
to their default values.

- `set g_skins_file ""` (string)  
Specifies name of the file to load skin list from. Should not include any
extenstion part or slashes. If skin list is specified, players may only use
skins defined in the list.

- `set g_bugs 0` (integer)  
Specifies whether some known Quake 2 gameplay bugs are enabled or not.
   - 0 - all bugs are fixed
   - 1 - ‘serious’ bugs are fixed
   - 2 - original Quake 2 behaviour

- `set g_teleporter_nofreeze 0` (boolean)  
Enables ‘no freeze’ (aka ‘q3’) teleporter behaviour.

- `set g_spawn_mode 1` (integer)  
Specifies deathmatch spawn point selection mode.
   - 0 - select random spawn point, avoiding two closest (bugged version)
   - 1 - select random spawn point, avoiding two closest (fixed version)
   - 2 - select random spawn point

   - 8 - power armor (screen and shield items)

- `set g_vote_mask 0` (bitmask)  
Specifies what proposals are available for voting.
   - 1 - change time limit
   - 2 - change frag limit
   - 4 - change item bans
   - 8 - kick a player
   - 16 - mute a player
   - 32 - change current map
   - 64 - toggle weapon stay
   - 128 - toggle respawn protection (between 0 and 1.5 sec)
   - 256 - change teleporter mode

- `set g_vote_time 60` (integer)  
Time, in seconds, after which undecided vote times out.

- `set g_vote_treshold 50` (integer)  
Vote passes or fails when percentage of players who voted
either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ becomes greater than this value.

- `set g_vote_limit 3` (integer)  
Maximum number of votes each player can initiate.

become server admins. Right now this gives them a decider voice in votes,
ability to see IP addresses in the output of ‘playerlist’ command and grants
access to a number of privileged commands (listed in `acommands` command output).

- `set g_team_chat 0` (boolean)

Allows one to globally disallow chat during the match (chat is still allowed
during the intermission).

   - 2 - chat is disabled for everyone

- `set g_protection_time 0` (float)  
Time, in seconds, for newly respawned players to be invincible.

Map list format
---------------

Map list is loaded at server startup from  `./openffa/mapcfg/${g_maps_file}.txt`.
Each line of the map list file should have the following format:
`<mapname> [min_players] [max_players] [flags]`. Minimum and maximum player
counts are optional, as well as flags. Flags can be either 1 or 2, which makes
the map entry not automatically selectable and not votable, respectively.

Skin list format
---------------

Skin list is loaded at server startup from  `./openffa/${g_skins_file}.txt`.
Each line of the skin list file should specify either a model name, or a skin name.
It should begin with a model (directory) name, optionally followed by skin names
allowed for that model. Model names are distinguished from skin names by the presence of
trailing slash, e.g. `male/` and `female/` are models, `grunt` and `anthena` are skins.
There may be several model names defined in the file. If there are no skins defined
for the model, then any skin can be used for that model. When player skins are
validated, if there is no matching skin found, then the last one defined for the matching
model is used. Likewise, if there is no matching model found, then the last one defined
in the file is used.
