About
-----

OpenFFA is a simple free-for-all deathmatch mod for Quake 2, an open source
replacement for ‘RegularDM’ mode of OSP Tourney. Currently in development, it
features familiar scoreboard and HUD, voting system, configurable map rotation
support, high scores logging, ‘proper’ in-eyes chasecam support. Besides that,
OpenFFA fixes many gameplay bugs and annoyances original Quake 2 game library
has.

    _duration_ parameter specifies how long this address should stay in the
    list. Default duration is 1 hour.  Maximum duration is 12 hours. Default
    units for specifying _duration_ are minutes. Add ‘h’ or ‘H’ suffix to

    connecting) or _mute_ (allow player to connect and enter the game, but
    disallow chat during the match). Default action is _ban_.

Server configuration
--------------------

Custom OpenFFA cvars are described below.

g_idle_time::
    Time, in seconds, after which inactive players are removed from the game.
    Default value is 0 (don't remove inactive players). Inactive players with
    ‘stuck’ buttons are removed faster.

g_idle_kick::
    Specifies whether inactive players are kicked or put into spectator mode.
    Default value is 0.
       - 0 - put inactive players into spectator mode
       - 1 - kick inactive players with ‘stuck’ buttons
       - 2 - kick inactive players

g_maps_random::
    Specifies whether map list is traversed in random on sequental order.
    Default value is 2.
       - 0 - sequental order
       - 1 - random order
       - 2 - random order, never allows the same map to be picked twice in a row

g_maps_file::
    Specifies name of the file to load map list from. Should not include any
    extenstion part or slashes. Default value is empty (no map list).

.Map list format
****************
Map list is loaded at server startup from ‘mapcfg/$\{g_maps_file\}.txt’.
Each line of the map list file should have the following format:

    <mapname> [min_players] [max_players] [flags]

Minimum and maximum player counts are optional, as well as flags. Flags can be
either 1 or 2, which makes the map entry not automatically selectable and not
votable, respectively.
***************

g_defaults_file::
    If this variable is not empty and there are some settings modified by
    voting, server will execute the specified config file after 5 minutes pass
    without any active players. Config file should reset all votable variables
    to their default values. Default value is empty.

g_skins_file::
    Specifies name of the file to load skin list from. Should not include any
    extenstion part or slashes. If skin list is specified, players may only use
    skins defined in the list. Default value is empty (no skin list).

.Skin list format
*****************
Skin list is loaded at server startup from ‘$\{g_skins_file\}.txt’.
Each line of the skin list file should specify either a model name, or a skin
name.  It should begin with a model (directory) name, optionally followed by
skin names allowed for that model. Model names are distinguished from skin
names by the presence of trailing slash, e.g. ‘male/’ and ‘female/’ are models,
‘grunt’ and ‘athena’ are skins.

There may be several model names defined in the file. If there are no skins
defined for the model, then any skin can be used for that model. When player
skins are validated, if there is no matching skin found, then the last one
defined for the matching model is used. Likewise, if there is no matching model
found, then the last one defined in the file is used.

It is highly recommended that a skin list is set up to prevent players from
specifying random skins, causing unwanted skin download attempts.
*****************

g_motd_file::
    Specifies name of the file to load MOTD from. Should not include any
    extenstion part or slashes. Default value is empty (no MOTD set).

g_highscore_path::
